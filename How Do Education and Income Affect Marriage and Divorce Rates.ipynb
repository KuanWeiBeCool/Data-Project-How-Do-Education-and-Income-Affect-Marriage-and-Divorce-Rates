    "# How Do Education and Income Affect Marriage and Divorce Rates?\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Recently, I hear many of my friends in China being asked to have \"blind dates\" by their parents, because they are at the ages which are supposed to get married. When I was little, I have heard stories that some parents asked their kids to get married when their kids reached 25 years old or so. Thus, I always know that this tradition does exist. But I still feel surprised when it happens right around me. My friends find it not reasonable to spend time having \"blind dates\" simply for getting married, as they have their career to focus on and they prefer to find a person who they love. However, their parents have different opinions. They think that marriage is essential as there will be a lot of difficulties and it will be very tough to face them all by ourselves, especially when we get older and our health conditions start to drop. So it's better to get things settled when we are young and healthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Personally, I don't believe either of them is wrong. On the side of their parents, they must be sharing the experience that makes them successful, and they wish their kids to have happier lives. On the side of my friends, they are definitely not wrong to focus on their careers and try to find their true love. So what makes them think so differently and hard to understand each other? After some thinking, I came up with one possible reason: their backgrounds are very different. During our parents' 20s, China was not as developed. They had much lower income and fewer educational resources. Besides, the country was not able to provide enough healthcare for everyone. Therefore, individuals need to rely more on their families. Nowadays, it's easier for young people to live by themselves, so young people can become more independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify my thought, I performed the analysis below. The analysis compares marriage rates and divorce rates in different countries, along with their GDP per capita and education scores, to find their inherent correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Source\n",
    "- The marriage and divorce rates come form [OECD Family Database](http://www.oecd.org/els/family/database.htm).\n",
    "- The GDP per capita comes from [The World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD).\n",
    "- The education score comes from [World Population Review](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/education-rankings-by-country/).\n",
    "- The ratios of couples who have children come from [OECD Family Database](http://www.oecd.org/els/family/database.htm).\n"

    "As shown from the above heatmap, some intuitive correlations can be found. The marriage rates have a positive correlation with the divorce rates. This makes sense as divorce must after when marriage happens. Total education score has a positive correlation with GDP per capita. This also reflects the truth that higher education results in higher income on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "More interestingly, marriage rates have negative correlations with GDP per capita and total education score. This finding verifies my hypothesis that people who live in a country with more gross income and educational resources are more independent. Another suprising observation is that divorce rate is independent of the GDP per capita, but has a positive correlation with education score. This means that country with citizens who accept more education tend to have higher divorce rate. This is counter-intuitive to me as I thought that people with better education will have greater chances to find good partners, and the divorce rate should be lower. One plausible explaination could be that people with higher education may have less willing to have children. [Study](https://www.wf-lawyers.com/divorce-statistics-and-facts/) has shown that couples with children have significant less divorce rate than couples without children."

    "In this project, I studied how GDP per capita and education influence the marriage rates and divorce rates. It was found that GDP per capita and education score have negative correlations with the marriage rates. The divorce rates are independent of GDP per capita, but have a positive correlation with the education score. The positive correlation between divorce rates and the education score was explained by a negative correlation between the education score and the ratio of couples who have children. "
